# Reader For Not Always Right

## Description

This is an android app that loads posts from the website notalwaysright.com, a site that I used to frequently visit. It will by default open each post made on the selected date(s) from the selected catagories in a separate tab. Alternatively the posts can be opened inside the app one at a time.

Made in Java using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/), and [ThreeTen Backport](https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).

## Installation

You can download NotAlwaysRightReaderForAndroid.apk and open it to install it on your android device. You will need to enable sideloading to do this if you have not done so prior. Alternatively you can download the whole repository and compile it yourself in android studio.

## Instructions

The first time you use the app you should use the gear in the upper right hand corner to select the settings you want to use. You can choose from 3 methods of selecting dates (one data, consecutive range of dates, or list of dates), whether you want posts opened in the app or your browser, and if the app should only open articles that you have not opened before. This menu also includes the option to reset the list of read articles.

On the main page of the app simply choose the date(s) you wish to view posts on and then choose the catagory you want the posts to be from. The bottom row of buttons scrolls to reveal more catagories. After a short wait (the length of the wait is greater when looking for older posts) the posts will open in your browser or a button will apear to view them in the app.
